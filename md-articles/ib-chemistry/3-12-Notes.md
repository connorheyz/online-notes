# 3/12 Ideal Gas Notes
## Sample Problems
- A 500. g block of dry ice vaoprizes to a gas a room temperature. Calculate the volume of gas produeced at 25C and 975 kPa.
$P = 975 kPa$
$V = ?$
$n = 500g$
$R = 8.314 kPa/mol$
$T = 298K$
$$ PV = nRT $$

| 500g | 1 mol CO<sub>2 |
|--|--|
| | 44.01 g CO<sub>2 |
$= 11.4 mol CO_2$
$$975 = 11.4(8.314)(298)$$
$= 29.0 L$
### Gases in Stoichiometry Problems

- At STP 1 mol (of any gas) = 22.4 L
- What volume of hydrogen at STP is produced by adding 15.0 g of sodium to an excess of nitric acid?
$$2Na(s) + 2HNO_3(aq) → H_2(g) + 2NaNO_3(aq)$$

| 15 g Na | 1 mol Na | 1 mol H<sub>2 | 22.4 L H<sub>2 |
|--|--|--|--|
| | 22.9 g Na | 2 mol Na | 1 mol H<sub>2|
= 7.31 L
## Kinetic Molecular Theory
### Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure
- The total pressure in a gas mixture is the sum of the partial pressures of the individual components
$$P_{total} = P_1 + P_2 + P_3 + ...$$
### Partial Pressure and Vapor Pressure
- **Vapor Pressure** - pressure due to the evaporation of a substance
- **Evaporation** -- the process of a liquid turning into a gas at temperatures below the boiling point

Partial Pressures can be reported in % composition or mole fractions. Values can be determined from total molar amounts.
#### Air Compsition
##### Percent Comp
- N$_2$ = 78.1%
##### Mole Fraction
- N$_2$ = 0.781
### Partial Pressure and Mole Fraction
- Frequently used when collecting gas over water
- Subtract Vapor Pressure from total pressure of system.

### Sample Problems
- A gas is collected by water displacement at 50°C and a barometric pressure of 95.00 kPa. What is the pressure exerted by the dry gas? (vapor pressure of water at 50°C = 12.34 kPa) 
<br>
- Oxygen gas is collected by water displacement from the reaction of water at 23°C and 1 atm. What is the mass of the dry O$_2$? (vapor pressure of water at 23°C = 2.81 kPa)
$$ 98.49 \times 0.318 = n \times 8.314 \times 296$$ 
$n = 0.0127$ mol

| 0.0127| 32.00g O$_2$ |
|--|--| 
| | 1 mol |
= 0.406g
