# HL Notes: Geometric Sequences and Series
## Geometric Sequence -
$$a_n = a_{n-1}r$$
<p align=center>r = common ratio</p>

$$r={a_n \over a_{n-1}}$$

## $n^{th}$ term of a geometric sequence -
$$a_1 = a_1$$
$$a_2 = a_1r$$
$$a_3 = a_2r$$
$$a_3 = a_1r^2$$
$$a_n = a_1r^{n-1}$$

## Practice Question # 1
$$8/1000, 9/600, 10/360$$
$$r = 0.6$$
### Method 1 (Recursively)
$$11/216, 12/129.6$$
### Method 2 (Explicitly)
$$1000 = a_1$$
$$a_5 = 1000(0.6)^4 = 129.6$$
### Part B
$$1360(.6)^2 = a_3 = 489.6$$
