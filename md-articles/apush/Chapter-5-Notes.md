## Fighting Begins

### Women..
 - Soldiers depended on women

### Slavery..
 - Slavery contradicted the revolution
 - "All men are created equal"
 - Immediately after the revolution, steps were taken to abolish slavery
 - Over time, people wanted it back

> The colonies got pretty close to abolishing slavery. People in the south were voluntarily freeing their slaves, and northern states were abolishing it completely. However, the economy demanded them back. The colonists were closer to abolishing slavery than giving women equal rights to men.
