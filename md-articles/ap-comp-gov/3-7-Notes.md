### Relations with the Supreme Leader
The president of Iran is the head of state and is mainly  a ceremonial figurehead. The supreme leader holds all of the power in the government.

## Jurist Guardianship
Jurist Guardianship is sort of like the opposite of the United States' checks and balances. It allows certain executive, legislative, and judicial powers that allow them to supersede powers and bodies. It grants the power to do what's right for the people according to Sharia Law. Some of these powers include:
- Vetting Candidates
- Supervising the Government

## Iran's Media
Both private and publicly owned media sites exist in Iran. However, they may be subject to censorship and cannot comment negatively on the government.

### The Revolution of 1979
Iran shuts down tons of media sites and censors political articles.

### Censorship
Negative political comments are heavily policed in private media.
