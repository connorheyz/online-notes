 - Heavy Industry that guides that manages nationalized factories.
The clergy dominates the bureaucracy and the presidency.
### Majiles
The Majiles first came to be in 1906 after the Constitutional Revolution. It was a part of Iran's early experiments with democracy.
#### Pahlavis
Although they can technically act independently, The Majiles acted as a rubber stamp legislature that let the shah do as they pleased.
#### Modern Times
The Majiles have a weakened relationship with the presidency. However, the Majiles still remain as the main legislation of Iran. Some of the Majiles' powers include:
 - Enacting or changing laws
 - Interpreting legislation

### Expediency Council
Because the Guardian Council and can overturn the laws made by the Majiles, they often argue fiercly. The Expediency Council referees their disputes. It orignially consisted of 13 clerics. Over time, it grew to 32 members with much more power than it used to have. For example, it can originate its own legislature.
### Assembly of Religious Experts
The assembly of religious experts is an 86-man house that is directly elected by the people every four years. The assembly, along with the supreme leader and the guardian council, broadly interpret the constitution.
### Judiciary
#### Pahlavis
Unlike most of Iran's government institutions, the Judiciary was completely secularized from the government. They had a European style judicial system and law codes in place.
#### Sharia
Sharia, or Islamic law, was built up over several centuries after the death of the religion's founder, Muhammad, in the 7th century. Sharia is considered to be the foundation of all islamic civilization.

## Political Parties
The constitution provides for political parties, but the government did not allow them until Muhammad Khatami's presidency in 1997. Since then, multiple parties have formed. Most of the parties are personality based, not issue based.
### Khordad Front
The election of 2000 saw many reformists fill the seats through a coalition of reformist parties known as the Khordad Front. They won 80% of the vote in a campaign and drew in over 70% of the electorate.
## Electoral System

### Single Member Plurality
Single Member Plurality (SMP) electoral systems, some times known as fist past the post, are simple systems to administer. The candidate who gets more votes than any other candidate is declared the winner.  Depending upon the number of candidates and their relative popularity, the winning candidate may or may not need a majority of votes to win. Iran uses a Single Member Plurality system with a two ballot run-off for the top two candidates.
### Run-Off Elections for President
A runoff election is a second general election conducted to determine which of the top vote-getters in the first general election will be elected to office. Runoffs occur in states that require candidates to receive a majority (as opposed to a plurality) of the vote to win an election. In Iran, run-off elections follow the single member plurality election if a candidate does not get more than 50% of the votes.
## Public Policy
### Population Policy
After years of successful efforts to curb its population growth by offering free or very inexpensive family planning services and promoting the idea that “two children are enough” in their health centers, Iran is dramatically changing its population policy. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced a new policy to encourage population growth saying that previous family planning was ungodly and a Western import. The new policy will pay families for each child and deposit money into that child’s bank account through their 18th birthday. This has the potential to undo the gains that were achieved under the old policy where population growth went from 3.9 percent a year in 1986 to 1.6 percent in 2006.
### Women's Rights
For Iranian women, their rights and legal status have changed since the early 20th century. Women's rights in Iran are limited compared to the women in developed nations. The World Economic Forum’s 2017 Global Gender Gap Report ranked Iran 140 out of 144 countries for gender parity.
#### Equality with Difference
Equality with Difference is Iran's policy towards women. It gives men more favor in divorce and custody laws according to islam law. Women must wear long scarves and coats in public, and cannot leave the country without their male relatives' permission.
### Nuclear Ambitions
The United States provided Iran with nuclear energy in the 1950s. Since then, Iran has been suspected of using it to develop weapons instead of civilian programs. In 2015, Iran negotiated the JCPOA, a 25 year nuclear agreement limiting Iran's nuclear capacity in exchange for sanctions relief. In 2018, Trump pulled out of JCPOA and reimplemented sanctions.
## Human Rights in Iran

### Baha'i
Iran has persecuted and arrested baha'i leaders for what they call "security reasons". Baha'i is an offshoot of islam and is viewed as unholy by Iran.
### Journalists
Iran does not have tolerance for slander against the government. News sites are not allowd to critisize the government. Journalists can be imprisoned for reporting about corruption in the government.
## Recent Elections
### Majiles Elections
#### 2004
The 2004 Majiles elections was a victory for the islamic conservatives over the reformists. The elections took place amidst the January 2004 decision to ban about 2500 candidates -- nearly half of the total -- including 80 sitting Parliament deputies. The main targets were reformist candidates.

#### Green Movement

The protest followed the announcement that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad had won the election with 63% of the votes. People on both sides of the issue poured onto the streets. The government sent the Basij to disperse the crowds, and violence followed. Around 20 people died.
#### Twitter & Facebook Impact
Social media and messaging apps have become crucial for antigovernment protestors around the world, as means of organizing and delivering messages to other citizens. Not suprisingly, Iran has blocked these apps to prevent protests and government slander.
#### Show Trials
There was a trial after the 2009 Iran poll protests. It had over 140 defendants who were being tries for orchestrating a revolution in Iran. The trials were widely condemned as being "show trials". A show trial is a public trial in which the judicial authorities have already determined the guilt of the defendant. The actual trial has as its only goal the presentation of both the accusation and the verdict to the public so they will serve as both an impressive example and a warning to other would-be dissidents or transgressors.
