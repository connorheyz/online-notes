#### The Emergence of the *Technicos* and the Pendulum Theory
- Miguel Aleman became president and set Pendulum Theory into place.
- He rejected some of Cardenas' changes and implemented  economic liberalization. He was followed by someone who re-implemented Cardenas' changes, creating a back and forth effect. ***Technicos***, educated, business oriented leaders, gained power. By the 1980s, Mexico practiced **neo-liberalism**. Mexico's GNP grew until the early 1980s. This was known as the **Mexican Miracle**.
