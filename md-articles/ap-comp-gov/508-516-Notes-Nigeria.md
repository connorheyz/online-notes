# Nigeria Reading: Political Institutions
## Linkage Institutions
### Political Parties
Most political parties in Nigeria are ethnic based. Nigeria's extreme factionalism created so many politcal parties that it was almost impossible to create a coherent party system. In 2015, these major parties supported presidential candidates.
 - **The People's Democratic Party (PDP)** --- The PDP has run candidates since 1998. The PDP is Obasanjo's party. The PDP has had a lot of presidentcies and a majority in the National Assembly. However, because of recent fraudulent elections, it is hard to tell how much support the PDP really has.
 - **All Progressive Congress** --- the All Progressive Congress is an alliance of four opposition parties. Muhammadu Buhari won the 2015 elections as an All Progressive Congress candidate.

Protests about the fraudulent elections of 2007 and 2011 made it hard for the PDP to claim legitimacy

A flurry of party registrations with the **Independent National Election Commission (INEC)** followed the death of president Abacha in 1998. In 1999, a party had to earn at least 5% of the vote in order to qualify. The INEC was accused of corruption. Goodluck Jonathan appointed an academic named Jega to make sure elections are not corrupted. This caused more fair elections in 2011 and 2015.

### National Elections
#### Presidential Elections
Elections after 1993. Majority vote needed. If majority is not met, a second ballot is held. Purely regional candidates cannot win. Candidates need 25% of the vote from 2/3 of the countries regions.
 - **1999**
 - **2003**
 - **2011** --- Goodluck Jonathan won in the first round, making him the first in Nigeria's history.
#### Legislative Elections
The Senate has 109 Senators, 3 from each of its 36 states. They are elected by popular vote. The 360 House of representatives seats are elected from single memeber districts. No run-off elections occur for these seats. It is mainly regional representation.
### Election Fraud
The 2003 and 2007 elections were highly fraudulent. In 2003, some politicians were assasinated. However, in 2007, things were even worse. Obasanjo tries to pass a bill that would let him run for three terms, and the races were deeply flawed on local and state levels.
### The Elections of 2011
The elections of 2011 were an improvement because of the changes the INEC implemented. Goodluck Jonathan won the presidency in the first round.
### The Elections of 2015
The elections of 2015 were also an improvement over 2003 and 2007. Muhammadu Buhari won the presidency and Goodluck Jonathan was the first president to lose re-election in Nigeria.

Boko Haram tried to disrupt the elections by attacking voting centers.

## Mass Media
In contrast to most less-developed countires, Nigeria has long had a well developed independent press. Most newspapers are in the South.
