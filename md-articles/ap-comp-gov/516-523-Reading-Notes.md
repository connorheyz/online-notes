# 516 -- 523: The Institutions of National Government
Nigeria is a federal system. Its constitution has three branches, but the execuive branch ultimately rules. Nice 1979, Nigeria has had a presidential system. It has 36 state governments and 774 local governments. Niether federalism nor checks and balances are in place.
## The Executive
In 1979, Nigeria went from a parliamentary system to a presidential system. It was modeled after the U.S. system until 1983. Buhari staged a coup. He was ousted by Babangida in '85, who was replaced by general Abacha in 1993. Civilian rule returned in 1999.
### Military Rule
Nigeria's seven military leaders did not all lead in the same fashion. All promised a "transition to democracy", but only two gave power over elected leaders. Obasanjo in 1979, and Buhari in 1983.
#### Patrimonialism
The president was the head of a large patorn-client system. The cabinet, and the bureacracy were all apart of the patronage.
## The Bureacracy
The British put an elaborate civil service in place in Nigeria. Since independence, the civil services have become bloated and corrupt.
### Para-Statals
Corporations that are owned by the government to provide welfare.
### State Corporatism
Corpoatism occurs where the government allows input from select interest groups. Because the interest groups are Para-Statals, it is state corporatism. One Para-Statal founded by Obasanjo to provide energy. It was called N.E.P.A. and some Nigerians joked it stood for "Never Expect Power Again". Nigeria has privatized a lot of power Para-Statals recently.

## The Legislature
The legislature has taken many forms since independence, and it has been disbanded a number of times by the military. Currently nigeria has a bicameral legislature called the **National Assembly**. Both houses serve renewable four year terms
### The Senate
 - 109 senators. 3 from each of the 36 states. 1 from the capital area, Abuja.
 - Elected by popular vote.
 - Some senators represent smaller populations.
 - Senators diverse a lot because of ethnicity.
### The House of Representatives
 - 360 members.
 - Elected by plurality.
 - Single-member districts.

Under military rule, the legislature has had almost no power. The legislature has only recently become a check on the president's power. A good example is when the National Assembly did not ratify Obasanjo's plan to alter the constitution to allow him to run for a third term. Senators and representatives have been involved in corruption scandals.
## The Judiciary
In the early years of independence, the judiciary was autonomous. Courts combined British law with traditional laws. They were known for making objective decisions.

Today, judicial review exists in theory. Courts exist at both federal and state levels. The highest court is the Supreme Court. The judiciary is complicated by *sharia* and British courts coexisting. The 1999 constitution established a Supreme court and a Federal Court of Appeals. It also established a unified court system at the state and sub-national levels.

**Mshood Abiolao**, the winner of the anulled election of 1993, was not served justice and died in custody.

The establishment of tribunals to hear accusations of voter fraud indicate that Nigeria is taking rule of law seriously.

## The Military
The military has been a strong force behind policy in Nigeria. The military made distinctions between the "military in barracks" and the "military in government." The former fufils traditional duties of the military. The military has been subject to internal discord. Babangida used patron-clientelism to move military officials around to stay in power.

The military is one of Nigeria's few national institutions, bringing some stability to the country.
