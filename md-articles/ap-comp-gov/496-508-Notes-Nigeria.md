# Nigeria Reading: 496 â†’ 508
## Societal Issues
There are many societal characteristics that make democratization a challenge:
 - **A large gap between the rich and poor** --- Distribution of wealth in Nigeria is not equal (.48 Gini Index).
 - **Health issues** --- High rates of HIV / AIDS. The government has not made AIDS a priority. 1/11 AIDS victims live in Nigeria.
 - **Literacy** --- Nigeria's literacy rate is 51.08%. This is below the worldwide average of around 85% but higher than most of Africa.

## Cleavages
Nigeria is like Russia. Both states had ethnic civil wars. Russia and the Chechnya are still fighting. Nigeria had the Biafran Civil War. These ethnic differences have made any agreement on the **national question** almost impossible.
 - **Ethnicity** --- Nigeria has between 250 and 400 ethnic groups. The three largest, the Igbo, the Yoruba, and the Hausa-Fani, do not agree and cannot speak each others' languages.
 - **Religion** --- Nigeria does not have a unifying ideology like communism that are in China and Russia. This causes competing religious groups to complicate the political system even more. Nigeria is 50% Muslim, 40% Christian, and 10% native religions.
 - **North & South** --- Nigeria was separated into three federated regions in 1955. This divided Nigeria into North and South. The North is mostly Muslim, and the South is mostly Christian.
 - **Rural & Urban** --- Most protests, political groups, electronic media, and newspapers are in the citites.
 - **Social Class** --- The division between elites and ordinary people is very large. The elites control the state and its resources to gain wealth. They stay in power by taking advantage of ethnic differences.

## Public Opinion and Political Participation
Nigeria has a rich history of civil society, but are told to be viewed as subjects rather than participants. Activites are taking place in civil society. There is somewhat of a free press in Nigeria.

### Patron-Clientelism
Largely based on personal loyalties. It causes political officials to skew the economic and political management. It establishes political participation, but at the cost of corruption.

### Civil Society
In Nigeria's postcolonial history, many interest groups have formed. For example, the MOSOP worked to apply national laws to secure financial benefits for the survival of the Ogoni people.

### Voting
Nigerian citizens have voted in national elections since 1959. However, a lot of elections have been fraudulent. Voter turnout has been low because of the terrorist group **Boko Haram**.

### Attitudes Toward Government
Nigerians have a low level of trust in the government. In the early days of independence, attitudes toward the government were more favorable. China, Mexico, and Nigeria are all characterized by patron-clientelism. This causes corruption in the states and low government trust.

### Protests and Political Participation
Since the return of democracy, religious movements have pushed for the government to listen to their needs. International oil companies have been major targets.

After Goodluck Jonathan was re-elected, there were a lot of protests. Boko Haram carried out shootings and bombings almost daily.

Goodluck Jonathan tried to get rid of Boko Haram, but was unsuccessful. Boko Haram continued attacks and even gained national attention with the kidnapping of over 250 schoolgirls. They eventually gained control of their homeland in Borno.
