## Sovereignty, Authority, and Power
Nigeria has very polarizing and opposing views on how the government should be run. The leaders and citizens can't agree on who rules and how. This is known as the **national question**.
### Constitutionalism
Nigeria's first constitution was written in 1914, but since then, eight more constitutions have been written. **constitutionalism** has eluded Nigeria.
### Legitimacy
The **national question** is at the heart of the country's legitimacy, so establishing legitimacy is a challenge. The military is an important organization that brings stability to an unstable country. Military leaders have commonly ruled Nigeria.

>#### Goodluck Jonathan
>Goodluck Jonathan was the 2010 Nigerian president. He was one of the few presidents who was not a military leader. He was unable to harness the military power to defeat Boko Haram, an Islamic terrorist group in the north.

After Nigeria gained independence from Britain in  1960, they have used the military to enforce their beliefs. However, the citizens are used to rule of law. Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha alienated citizens and corrupted their leaderships.

>#### Ibrahim Babangida
>Ibrahim Babangida ruled from 1985 to 1993. He was known for being corrupted.

>#### Sani Abacha
>Sani Abacha ruled from 1993 to 1998. He is known for corruption and alienating citizens.

An Important source of legitimacy in the north has been *sharia*, especially since the fall of military leadership in 1999.

>#### Sharia
> *Sharia* is Islamic law derived from the Qur'an and Muhammad's teachings. They are not laws, but principles.

In 2008 the government banned religious and ethnic militias. Sharia law is beginning to return in Nigeria.

### Political Traditions
Kingdoms appeared as early as 800 CE, and historical influences may be divided into three eras:

#### Pre-Colonial Era
Centralized states developed early in Nigeria. Transportation and communication were easier in the South. The north needed government to coordinate crops irrigation. Influences from this era include:
- **Trade connections** -- The Niger River and Sahara Desert opened connections with other trading civilizations.
- **Early Islam influence** -- Islam gradually replaced traditional customs and religions.
- **Kinship-based politics**
#### Colonial Era
