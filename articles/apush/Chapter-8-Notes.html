<h3 id="landmark-cases">Landmark Cases</h3>
<ul>
<li>Several of John Marshall’s rulings were landmark cases</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section">1803</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Marbury v. Madison</em> – Appointment of midnight justices by John Adams rejected by Jefferson. Supreme Court decided constitutionality of Judiciary Act.  Court ruled delivery of appointments not duty of court and declares Judiciary Act unconstitutional. Significance of Ruling:  gave the Court the power of judicial review</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-1">1810</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Fletcher v. Peck</em> – Georgia legislature canceled contract that granted land to speculators as part of bribe. S. Court ruled deal was legal and the state couldn’t nullify it even if it was gained with bribe. Significance of Ruling: established the principle that state laws are invalid when in conflict with the Constitution</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-2">1816</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Martin v. Hunter’s Lease</em> – Loyalist, Fairfax, had his land seized after Revolutionary War.  He left land to relative following his death but Virginia seized it. Court overturned state court ruling. Jay’s Treaty and Treaty of Paris both stated loyalist land would be returned.  Significance of ruling: confirmed the Supreme Court’s right to overrule a state court.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-3">1819</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Dartmouth College v. Woodward</em> – Maryland wanted to tax branch of national bank. Court ruled against state. Significance of Ruling: upheld the right of Congress to charter a national bank, thus putting into national law the doctrine of implied powers.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-4">1819</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>McCulloch v. Maryland</em> – State wanted to make Dartmouth public school; charter was from King George III for private. Court rules charter cannot be changed by state. Significance of Ruling: by forbidding the state legislature to alter the college charter, established the principle that charters were contracts which could not be impaired.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-5">1821</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Cohens v. Virginia</em> – The state had tried and imprisoned people for illegally selling lottery tickets. Court ruled the state had the right to enforce the law which had not conflicted with the Constitution. Significance of Ruling: State courts must submit to federal jurisdiction and the federal court has the right to judicial review of state supreme court decisions</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="section-6">1824</h4>
<ul>
<li><em>Gibbons v. Odgen</em> – State had given navigation monopoly which controlled waterways in NY. Court ruled monopoly unconstitutional because states cannot control trade. Significance of Ruling: gave the national government undisputed control over interstate commerce. This freed internal transportation from state restraint. (year in AMSCO is typo, it’s 1824)</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p>Analysis: Explain why these decisions are “landmark.”<br>
They had a significant impact on how future cases would play out and set up the basic laws and structures of the Judiciary. It tested the new judicial system and proved it successful.</p>
