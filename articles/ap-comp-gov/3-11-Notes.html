<h2 id="warm-ups">Warm-Ups</h2>
<h3 id="tehran">Tehran</h3>
<p>Tehran only wanted specific things to be shown. There was a lack of infrastructure. There were no traffic lights. It looked like a normal city.</p>
<h4 id="university">University</h4>
<p>There are a lot of educated women. More than half of college students are women They are mostly pro-secular. The schools are either all women or all men.</p>
<h4 id="tehrans-youth">Tehran’s Youth</h4>
<p>Tehran’s youth is mostly pro western. They want western influence. They have modem buildings</p>
<h2 id="documentary">Documentary</h2>
<p>A documentary of Tehran by Thomas Erdbrink.</p>
<h3 id="people">People</h3>
<ul>
<li>The people were very worried about foreigners.</li>
<li>They think is is not honorable for the woman to ask the man.</li>
<li>A lot of people are not willing to rent an apartment to a single woman.</li>
<li>Some people can’t deal with the fact that their wives work.</li>
<li>People still hold on to traditional values such as wearing a chad-or and praying all the time.</li>
<li><strong>Muhammad Pahlavi</strong> – overthrown in 1979. After his reign, women were forced to wear veils and alcohol was banned.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="conservative-towns">Conservative Towns</h3>
<p>It’s like traveling 20 years into the past. There are five prayer services a day and all women wear black. Things do not change that much. Tehran is like a metropolis compared to here.</p>
<h3 id="day-to-day-life-in-tehran">Day to Day Life in Tehran</h3>
<p>Thomas meets his in-laws in the hot tub every morning to discuss women and politics. After lunch, Thomas goes out. The people approach him because foreigners are so rare. People ask him questions like, “What are you doing?”, “Why are you here?”, and “What does America think of Tehran?” There are a lot of invisible rules like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Women can’t sit in the front of the bus</li>
<li>Women shouldn’t ask the man to marry them.</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a lot of cliched journalism.  The westerners try to say stuff like, “We bypassed the rules and saw {x}”</p>
