<h2 id="cleavages-table">Cleavages Table</h2>
<h3 id="ethnic-cleavages">Ethnic Cleavages</h3>
<p>Nigeria has between 250 and 400 ethnic groups. The three largest, the Igbo, the Yoruba, and the Hausa-Fani, do not agree and cannot speak each others’ languages.</p>
<h3 id="religious-cleavages">Religious Cleavages</h3>
<p>Nigeria does not have a unifying ideology like communism that are in China and Russia. This causes competing religious groups to complicate the political system even more. Nigeria is 50% Muslim, 40% Christian, and 10% native religions.</p>
<h3 id="geographic-cleavages">Geographic Cleavages</h3>
<p>Nigeria was separated into three federated regions in 1955. This divided Nigeria into North and South. The North is mostly Muslim, and the South is mostly Christian.</p>
<h3 id="urban--rural">Urban &amp; Rural</h3>
<p>Most protests, political groups, electronic media, and newspapers are in the citites.</p>
<h3 id="social-class">Social Class</h3>
<p>The division between elites and ordinary people is very large. The elites control the state and its resources to gain wealth. They stay in power by taking advantage of ethnic differences.</p>
<h2 id="niger-delta-documents">Niger Delta Documents</h2>
<h3 id="blood-oil">Blood Oil</h3>
<p>Niger militants are ransacking American oil providers. International oil providers backed out of Nigeria after military conflict got out of hand. There were 800,000 barrels of oil lost a day because of it. This is troublesome for the american market. It could skyrocket the oil prices and put the american economy in a vulnerable place.</p>
<h3 id="has-boko-haram-been-defeated">Has Boko Haram been Defeated?</h3>
<p>President Buhari has claimed that Boko Haram’s activities have been greatly reduced since his presidency. His opponents say he is lying. He is not wrong, but Boko Haram is still active and on the rise. They have kidnapped hundreds since Buhari’s presidency.</p>
