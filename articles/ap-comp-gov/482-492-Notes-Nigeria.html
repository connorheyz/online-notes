<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>History of tradition based kingdoms and colonialism</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nigeria faces daunting problems</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nigeria is Africa’s most populous state, with about  140 million citizens.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>70% live in poverty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PPP — $6000/yr</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Islam and Christian Cleavages</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lack of coherent national identity</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nigeria has had fraudulent elections such as the national election of 2007</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>They are taking steps. 2011 and 2015’s national elections were far cleaner.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sovereignty-authority-and-power">Sovereignty, Authority, and Power</h2>
<p>Nigeria has very polarizing and opposing views on how the government should be run. The leaders and citizens can’t agree on who rules and how. This is known as the <strong>national question</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="constitutionalism">Constitutionalism</h3>
<p>Nigeria’s first constitution was written in 1914, but since then, eight more constitutions have been written. <strong>constitutionalism</strong> has eluded Nigeria.</p>
<h3 id="legitimacy">Legitimacy</h3>
<p>The <strong>national question</strong> is at the heart of the country’s legitimacy, so establishing legitimacy is a challenge. The military is an important organization that brings stability to an unstable country. Military leaders have commonly ruled Nigeria.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="goodluck-jonathan">Goodluck Jonathan</h4>
<p>Goodluck Jonathan was the 2010 Nigerian president. He was one of the few presidents who was not a military leader. He was unable to harness the military power to defeat Boko Haram, an Islamic terrorist group in the north.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After Nigeria gained independence from Britain in  1960, they have used the military to enforce their beliefs. However, the citizens are used to rule of law. Ibrahim Babangida and Sani Abacha alienated citizens and corrupted their leaderships.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="ibrahim-babangida">Ibrahim Babangida</h4>
<p>Ibrahim Babangida ruled from 1985 to 1993. He was known for being corrupted.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="sani-abacha">Sani Abacha</h4>
<p>Sani Abacha ruled from 1993 to 1998. He is known for corruption and alienating citizens.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An Important source of legitimacy in the north has been <em>sharia</em>, especially since the fall of military leadership in 1999.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4 id="sharia">Sharia</h4>
<p><em>Sharia</em> is Islamic law derived from the Qur’an and Muhammad’s teachings. They are not laws, but principles.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 2008 the government banned religious and ethnic militias. Sharia law is beginning to return in Nigeria.</p>
<h3 id="political-traditions">Political Traditions</h3>
<p>Kingdoms appeared as early as 800 CE, and historical influences may be divided into three eras:</p>

<p>Centralized states developed early in Nigeria. Transportation and communication were easier in the South. The north needed government to coordinate crops irrigation. Influences from this era include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Trade connections</strong> — The Niger River and Sahara Desert opened connections with other trading civilizations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Early Islam influence</strong> — Islam gradually replaced traditional customs and religions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Kinship-based politics</strong> — political organizations did not go past the village level.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Complex political identities</strong> — The difference between centralized state and local governance is not clear cut.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Democratic impulses</strong> — Rulers were expected to seek advice and to govern in the interest of the people. If they did not, they were often removed from their position.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>During the colonial era, Great Britain implemented both rule of law and practices that went against democracy. Influences from this era include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Authoritarian rule</strong> — Britain ruled by implementing chiefs that govern with Britain’s economic goals in mind. Britain increased the Authority of the chiefs, making them only accountable to the British.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>The interventionist state</strong> — The colonialists trained chiefs to run the country in order to reach economic goals. The people learned to just listen to the government .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Individualism</strong> — In Nigeria it caused the chiefs to think about the personal benefits of governence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Christianity</strong> — The British brought christianity with them to Nigeria. This created a Muslim Christian cleavage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intensification of ethnic politics</strong> — Three ethnic groups:</p>
<ul>
<li>Huasa-Fulani</li>
<li>Igbo</li>
<li>Yoruba</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The British pitted them agaisnt each other in order to manage the colonies.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Nigeria struggled to implement parliamentary systems and established a military dictatorship in 1966. Traditions established in this era include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Parliamentary system replaced by a presidential system</strong> — From 1960 to 1979 Nigeria followed the British parliamentary system. However, ethnic divisions made it hard to identify a majority party or allow a prime minister to have the right authority. In 1979 the country switched to a presidential system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Intensification of ethnic conflict</strong> — After ethnic conflicts, and Igbo military group seized power in 1966 and established military rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Military rule</strong> — The militray was kept in power by charismatic legitimacy. There was a coup that killed the first Igbo leader. This caused the Biafran Civil War, a fight for Igbo Independence of their land, called Biafra. The country remained together under military rule.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Corruption</strong> — Native leaders lost touch with traditions that encouraged them to govern in the interest of the people.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Federalism</strong> — In an attempt to calm down ethnic tensions, Nigerian leaders set up a federal system. This system did not work well under military rule. However, after the military lost power, Nigeria benefited from the federal system.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Economic dependence on oil</strong> — Nigeria’s rich oil reserves have proved to be too tempting temping for most military rulers to resist. Corruption has caused the oil industry’s money to only benefit the elite. However, Nigeria is entirely dependent on oil for political and economic stability, so this creates some problems.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="political-culture">Political Culture</h3>
<p>Nigeria’s political culture is shaped by ethnic diversity and conflict, corruption, and a politically active military. It also includes a democratic tradition to reinstate leadership that governs for the people. Characteristics of the political culture include</p>
<ul>
<li>Patron-clientelism (prebendalism)</li>
<li>State control</li>
<li>Rich civil society</li>
<li>Tension between modernity and tradition</li>
<li>Religious conflict</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="geographic-influences">Geographic Influences</h4>
<p>Nigeria’s ethnic groups can be divided into six geographic zones:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Northwest</strong> — Hausa-Fauni people, predominately Muslim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Northeast</strong> — Home to smaller groups, also Muslim.</p>
</li>
